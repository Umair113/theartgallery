### How it works

**Login/Register:** The user registers by submitting their firstname, lastname, username, country, and password. Then the app takes the user to login screen where the user enters their information to login. After that the user can either buy art or sell it.

**Buy:** In buy, there are listings of art being sold by other users. The user can click on buy and it will add the item to cart.

**Cart:** The cart lists all the items, that the user has added to cart, in a table and the sum total of the prices. After clicking the buy button, the amount will be deducted from the wallet and the user will be taken to a "bought" page.

**Sell:** The user can sell items by entering the title, price, name of the artist and uploading an image of the art. After clicking on the sell button, the amount is added to the wallet of the user and the user is taken to a "sold" page and here the user has the option to either sell more items or buy them.

**Dashboard:** Dashboard greets the user with "Good morning, good afternoon or good evening" based on the time of the day. Here the user can add funds and change username and password.
